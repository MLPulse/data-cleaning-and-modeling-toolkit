# Data Cleaning and Modeling Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning model training. It is designed to handle common data preprocessing tasks such as missing data imputation, feature scaling, encoding, and model evaluation. The toolkit also supports multiple machine learning models and offers visualization tools for better data understanding.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing data by visualizing and imputing missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Provides tools for scaling, encoding, and selecting features.
- **Modeling**: Includes methods to train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Stacking).
- **Visualization**: Offers data visualization tools to explore missing data, feature importance, and more.
